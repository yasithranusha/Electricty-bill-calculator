The electricity board wanted to develop  a software to calculate the customer's monthly electricity bill. As this for the first time the CEB wanted to implement the new system only to a small village with only 100 customers using the electricity. Details are as follows;

The inputs to the program are Customer Number, Customer Name, Tariff Code and Number of Units.

Tariff code: D-Domestic Customer and C-Commercial customer

Charges should be calculated as follows:

*For Domestic Customer:
        $5 per unit for first 100 units
        $10 per unit for excess of 100 units

*For commercial Customer:
        $10 per unit for first 200 units
        $15 per unit for excess of 200 units

Expected outputs:
